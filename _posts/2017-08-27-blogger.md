Just a little blogging app. One day build from `rails new` to what majesty you see on Heroku now. There's some image uploading using [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), some authorization using [Sorcery](https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery), and your basic crud functionality. The styling was plug and play, I was pretty much just building out the BE. Hosting is on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), db is [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), and it uses [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma). Fun!
