Just a little blogging app. One day build from the ground up. There's some image uploading using [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), some authorization using [Sorcery](https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery), and your basic crud functionality. The styling was provided (mostly). Hosting is on Heroku, db is postgres, and it uses puma. Fun!
