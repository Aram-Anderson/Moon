There are clear instructions in the ReadMe about getting this app stood up. Unfortunately, Heroku was mad about the size of the CSV data we were using, so the app isn't live there.

This app is a Rails backend that serves Json data from quite a few different API endpoints. This was a fun project, and I have plans to build out a separate front end in either React or Elm that will show the data.
