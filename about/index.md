<center>Just a human learning to talk to non-human things</center>

I'm a student at [The Turing School](https://www.turing.io/) at the moment. I'm absolutely loving the experience. I can't recommend that place enough. Drop me a line if you have any questions about it. I'd be happy to chat with you.

Here are some things about me:

I've worn a lot of hats in life...both figuratively and literally. Mostly baseball caps in the literal, though I don't wear them much these days. I'm trying to care about my hair (though an unfortunate turn of events at a barber recently caused me to shave it off). I'm trying to care about a lot of things. In the figurative hat department it's been mostly calloused hands and dirt under my nails. I've been an aircraft mechanic for the government of these here United States (contract work, uniform provided, job security for 4 *long* years), a car mechanic, a boat mechanic, and for a brief stint a heavy equipment mechanic in a big underground mine. That one was weird, and I can't say I would recommend it. It's not good for you if you like being a well adjusted human. I've also made my living building custom model railroads for eccentric railroad buffs. That was cool. I ran my own custom furniture company that consisted of precisely one employee (me). In that endeavor I mostly learned that I'm not good at business, and I really just like making stuff. Unfortunately, that is not a realization that equated to rent getting paid, so I closed up shop.

My education is in sociology and philosophy, which I was surprised to learn is not especially highly valued in our economic system. Imagine my shock! Philosophy does, however, lend itself well to coding. Code is lots of little logic problems, and so is philosophy since Descartes. Maybe all those student loans will pay off after all.
